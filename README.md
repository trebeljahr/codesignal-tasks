# Code Signal Tasks

These are the solutions of the CodeSignal Tasks I am doing.

If you do not know CodeSignal you should definitely check it out! [https://codesignal.com/](https://codesignal.com/)

It is a pretty nifty website, where you can solve little algorithmic challenges in an online editor in a lot of different languages and then compare your solutions to those of other people. Also the whole platform is really gamified and I have a lot of fun with it. 

I personally use it to learn and test my understanding of different languages and challenge myself to learn about all matter of different things in a practical way.
