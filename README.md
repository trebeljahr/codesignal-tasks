# Code Signal Tasks

These are the solutions of the CodeSignal Tasks I am doing.

If you do not know CodeSignal you should definitely check it out! [https://codesignal.com/](https://codesignal.com/)

It is a pretty nifty website, where you can solve little algorithmic challenges in an online editor in a lot of different languages and then compare your solutions to those of other people. Also the whole platform is really gamified and a lot of fun. 

I personally use it to learn and test my understanding of different languages and challenge myself to learn about all matter of different things in a practical way. If you try it out yourself, try getting the Polyglot Badge ;) 


## Want your own repository like this? -> Create your own: 

This repo is basically auto-generated. I wrote a small script to parse the CodeSignal Website and scrape my own content off of it. If you want to use the script yourself - you can find it here: 

https://github.com/trebeljahr/scrape-code-signal-tasks

It uses puppeteer to open a browser, login to the account, go to the tasks page, gather the links of all solved tasks, going onto the site for each of the tasks and scraping the contents of solution and description. The script even has little spinners and message to guide you through what it is doing.
